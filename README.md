################################# DESCRIPTION

Quippysync is an application that can help schools sync their students' Active Directory accounts with their student manaagement system (SMS). The application has 4 main function:

1) Create Accounts - If an account exists in the schools's SMS but not in their Active Directory, the account will be created.
2) Disable Accounts - If an account exists in the school's Active Directory but not in their SMS, the account will be disabled.
3) Enable Accounts - If a previously disabled account reappears in the school's SMS, the account will be enabled in Active Directory.
4) Move Accounts - If an account moves to a different OU in the school's SMS, it will be moved to the correct OU in Active Directory.
